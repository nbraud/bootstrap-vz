Oracle
======

The `Oracle <https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/compute>`__ provider creates RAW
images compressed in a ``.tar.gz`` tarball. Those images can be uploaded using
the web interface of the Oracle Compute Cloud Service dashboard or configured
to be automatically sent by our Oracle Storage Cloud Service API embedded
client.

Manifest settings
-----------------

Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~

The settings described below should be placed in the ``credentials`` key under
the ``provider`` section, if the image is intended to be uploaded after
generation. They will be used to authenticate the API client.

-  ``username``: the same login used to access the Oracle Compute Cloud
   dashboard.
   ``required``
-  ``password``: password for the username specified above.
   ``required``
-  ``identity-domain``: this is auto-generated by Oracle and available in the
   "New Account Information" e-mail message they send after registration.
   ``required``

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    provider:
      name: oracle
      credentials:
        username: user@example.com
        password: qwerty123456
        identity-domain: usoracle9999

Provider
~~~~~~~~

If the ``credentials`` have been specified, the following settings are
available to customize the process of uploading and verifying an image.

-  ``container``: the container (folder) to which the image will be uploaded.
   ``required``
-  ``verify``: specifies if the image should be downloaded again and have its
   checksum compared against the local one.
   Valid values: ``true``, ``false``.
   Default: ``false``.
   ``optional``

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    provider:
      name: oracle
      container: compute_images
      verify: true
